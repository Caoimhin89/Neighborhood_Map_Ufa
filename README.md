# Udacity_Project_5

Ufa is a fairly large city in Russia's southern Ural mountains region. I studied there for a year in 2012 and would like
to show you some of the major points of interest in the city and allow you to get a feel for the atmosphere and enjoy
some of the same experience I had on my trip.

To use this application all you need to do is click on one of the location markers on the map to see an info-window appear with an image of the location and a brief description. You can also click "About the City" on large screens to open a modal that describes the city for those who aren't familiar with it. (The circular blue info button does the same on smaller screens). You can open the side-navigation menu by clicking on the "Points of Interest" button (on large screens) or the orange seal of Bashkortostan button (on small screens). There you can find a list of noteworthy places in the city. Clicking on one of them will open the info-window for that location on the map.To narrow your list, just type the
name of the location you would like to focus on and the list will be filtered to include only the location you've 
typed into the search bar.

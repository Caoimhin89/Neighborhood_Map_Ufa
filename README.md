# Udacity_Project_5

Ufa is a fairly large city in Russia's southern Ural mountains region. I studied there for a year in 2012 and would like
to show you some of the major points of interest in the city and allow you to get a feel for the atmosphere and enjoy
some of the same experience I had on my trip.
